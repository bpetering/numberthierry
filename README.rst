numberthierry
=============

Number Thierry is a framework for introspecting and contextualizing integers;
that is, checking various useful properties like primality, and establishing
their context within both the abstract universe of integers and the concrete
universe of accumulated human knowledge.

If that sounds like a lofty goal, install the package and try out some
[examples], read the code, then start creating your own modules. Thierry is
deliberately very modular, with the modules defining simple interfaces and
having a logical hierarchy.

Thierry is also designed to be easily integrated with Python code and within
other software environments ([Chrome], [Django]).

Performance

Obviously this is all performance critical - when doing a large number of tests
or testing many integers, faster is much better.

What's up with the name?

For non-native English speakers, the name is a pun on the term "number theory",
the [branch of mathematics concerned with the study of integers].

Thierry is an upstanding young gentleman (*cough*), experienced in the
instruction of young ladies in the mathematickal arts.
